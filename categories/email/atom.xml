    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As this domain <em>zhantong.org</em> is purchased from Namecheap, I can enjoy (maybe?) its email service without any charge for 2 months. I used QQ Business Email. It&rsquo;s good, however, it may block English messages as spam. So I start the trial with Namecheap email hosting yesterday. I&rsquo;ll write my experience in this post.</p>

<p>It is a good thing that Namecheap uses Open-Xchange (OX) so that it has a much-better-looking UI instead of ugly ISP-provided email (which is a lot better than my CBE email before it switches to Google Apps). The UI is easy to use because it is simple.</p>

<p>The Contacts feature has a separate folder to store people who I send email to (I could add people who send me email, too).</p>

<p>It provides a web drive. Though it claims that it support WebDav, I cannot mount it in Nautilus with an HTTP 402 error. It support document viewer (and can be used to view email attachment). OX has a function to edit, but, an expensive Buisiness plan is required.</p>
