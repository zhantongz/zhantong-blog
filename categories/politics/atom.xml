    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After I got my new laptop, a ThinkPad L440 with Windows 8 pre-installed, I filed a complaint against Microsoft and Lenovo this thurday (Jul. 10, 2014) for tied-selling of the computer and Microsoft Windows 8 to the Competition Bureau of the government of Canada. <a href="http://cpbl.wordpress.com/2010/11/04/tied-selling-of-windows-os-with-computer-hardware-in-canada-a-complaint-to-the-competition-bureau/">The Red Pen</a> tried this before and the Bureau, in my opinion, did not respond appropriately because their conduct is anti-competitive. Although it is highly likely that the Bureau reacts the same, I filed the complaint to express my concern about Microsoft monopoly. I encourage you to do so if you are in Canada and in a similar circumstance so that the government one day may choose to put an end. If you are in another country, I hope you can find a way to complain to your government according to similar laws, e.g. State Administration for Industry and Commerce in China who is responsible for the enforcement of 《中华人民共和国反不正当竞争法》; and in most countries, you can always file a lawsuit asking for refund in a small claims court. You may email me to know the details of the complaint.</p>
